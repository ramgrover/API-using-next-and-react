Leveraging our knowledge of React and Next.js to create an interface for viewing listings.

Objective:
To continue to work with our "Listings" API (from Assignment 1) on the client-side to produce a rich user interface for
accessing data. For this assignment, we will be leveraging our knowledge of React and Next.js to create an interface for
viewing listings. Please Note: Once again, you're free to style your app however you wish. The following specification
outlines how we can use the React-Bootstrap Components (Bootstrap 5). If you wish to add additional images, styles or
functionality, please go ahead.
